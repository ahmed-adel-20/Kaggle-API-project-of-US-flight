## 📊 Project Overview

This project visualizes flight data from the year 2015 using **Power BI**, providing insights into flight numbers, delays, cancellations, and airline performances across the United States. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle, and I've used a custom Python script to connect the Kaggle API and load the data into Power BI.
